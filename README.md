Testing how to use some container vulnerabilities scanners with Azure DevOps CI/CD pipelines

> **Work in progress**

This repository features multiple Azure DevOps YAML pipelines that will show you how you can use a few of the most well-known vulnerability scanners in the market right now.

The scanners that I'll be using are the following ones: 
- AWS Elastic Container Registry integrated scanner using Clair.
- AquaSec Trivy.
- Azure Defender for ACR scan.
- Qualys Container scanner.
